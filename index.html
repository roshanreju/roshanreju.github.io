                <h1>Roshan Reju</h1>
                <p class="matrix-effect">Greetings! I am a Cybersecurity professional with a proven track record of success in the industry. Holding a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology, Kochi, I am now excitedly embarking on a new academic journey pursuing a Master's degree in Cybersecurity at Northeastern University. During my tenure as an Associate Security Engineer at H&R Block, I played pivotal roles in both the Application Security Team and the CSIRT 24*7 team. This experience has significantly honed my expertise in various cybersecurity domains. Moreover, my passion for security research has driven me to actively participate in bug bounty programs with Bug Crowd and HackerOne, contributing to the broader cybersecurity community. With proficiency in Ethical Hacking, Penetration Testing- Android, Web Applications, APIs, Thick Clients and Python and Java Programming, I am always eager to stay at the forefront of the rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape. My dedication to continuous learning and professional development has been acknowledged by the EC Council, which awarded me the CEH certification, and I have also been twice nominated as a finalist in the CEH Hall of Fame Awards.
                    
                    As I embark on my academic journey at Northeastern University, I am excited about gaining deeper insights into cutting-edge cybersecurity techniques and further enhancing my skills to combat ever-evolving threats. My ultimate goal is to make a meaningful impact in the cybersecurity industry. I remain open to connecting with like-minded professionals to share knowledge and explore potential collaborations.
                    
                    Let's connect! Feel free to reach out to me to learn more about my background, expertise, and future aspirations in the cybersecurity realm. Together, let's contribute to a safer digital world.</p>
